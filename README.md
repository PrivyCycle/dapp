PrivyCycle
Your cycle, your data—securely yours.

A Web3-native period-tracking app built with end-to-end encryption. Whether you’re Web3-savvy or coming straight from Web2, PrivyCycle makes it seamless to record, control, and share your menstrual health information.

Problem Statement
Most period-tracking apps expose or sell intimate cycle data, putting users at risk. Once you log your history, there’s no guarantee you can ever get it back—or keep it private if the company folds. Doctors, partners, and future family members have no easy, secure way to access the insights they need, and critical health patterns may be lost forever.

PrivyCycle provides a truly private vault for your cycle data, encrypts everything for you, and gives you simple tools to share it only with people you trust.

Key Features
End-to-End Encryption
All cycle logs—period dates, symptoms, moods, lifestyle entries—are encrypted on your device before they ever leave it.

Seamless Web2-Style UX
Social-login via Privy (e.g. Google, Apple) lets anyone start tracking in seconds, with no crypto jargon.

Encrypted Local Storage
Zircuit’s encryption SDK keeps your raw data safe on your phone; only you hold the decryption keys.

AI-Driven Suggestions
0G powers fully anonymized insights for users, doctors, and partners—no personal data ever exposed.

IPFS-Backed Portability
Your encrypted logs live on IPFS: you can export or revoke access for doctors, partners, or family members (sisters, daughters, etc.) at any time.

“Gift to Daughter” Snapshot
Create an encrypted archive of your cycle history that you can hand off to your daughter when she needs it—no minting or time-lock complexity.

Open Source & Audit-Friendly
MIT-licensed code, reproducible builds, and community-driven security reviews.
